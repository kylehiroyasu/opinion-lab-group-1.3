    "The idea of our project is to evaluate text classifiers trained using only pairwise labels to identify entities and attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic approach will be that we have various sentences which are labeled referring to a specific entity and attribute. However instead of training a classifier directly on these explicit labels, we will show a model two examples and then tell the model if they contain the same entity/attribute or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means while we are preprocessing data the most important aspects to save are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the sentence\n",
    "- what entity it contains\n",
    "- what attribute it contains\n",
    "\n",
    "In general this means we will concentrate on using the `train` and `GOLD` versions of the `SB1` datasets because they contain the sentence level information.\n",
    "\n",
    "However the following lead to a complicated data model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a single text element can have multiple entities/attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideas for data model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our data is small, and we want to work on the data in a pairiwise sentence fashion, it would be easiest to completely denormalize, and flatten the data down to the sentence level. I will start with basically one python dictionary per sentence, and then we can transform the list of dictionaries into a pandas dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- how to do we treat sentences with mutliple entities and attributes\n",
    "- in the data annotation scheme there is a `general` attribute value, should we use this?\n",
    "- what about the out-of-scope data?\n",
    "- in theory we can use sentences with no entity/attribute label as confirmation it doesn't match any given entity/label pair. should this also be done? Does that mean that two sentences with no entity/attribute do match? \n",
    "- in terms of tokenization, should we use the same tokenization for both embeddings, or match to how models were trained\n",
    "- You initially suggest we start with token embeddings, for GloVe this is obviously the only choice, however more modern architectures also include document embeddings, instead of trying to compress/token embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For data preprocessing, we should probably consider the following high level steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- General preprocessing\n",
    "    - replacing '&amp;' with '&' for example\n",
    "    - shortening words with repeated letters: 'the computer is slowwwww' -> 'the computer is slow'\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Embedding specific preprocessing:\n",
    "    - GloVe:\n",
    "        - tokenize and lowercase using Stanford Tokenizer\n",
    "    - Bert:\n",
    "        - ?\n",
    "        \n",
    "After more dicussion to keep things simple the following will be done in this notebook\n",
    "- denormlize data down to the entity/attribute - sentence level\n",
    "- generate statistics for attributes and entities\n",
    "- start with standard tokenization\n"
